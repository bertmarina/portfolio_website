          This is the first travel I did to India and it was definitely intense. Every day we had at least 5/7 hours on
          the bus because the distance between each leg was quite big and the roads in India are not even close to what
          we are used here in Europe. As the first bite of this huge country, I chose <b>Rajasthan</b> and I travelled
          with the same agency I travelled to Sri Lanka before, <b>Viaggi e Avventure nel Mondo</b>. Before digging
          into the specifics of the travel, though, I think a brief introduction is important.
          <br>Rajasthan, known as the Land of Kings, is the richest region of India with fortresses and majestic
          architectonical works. This is the land of the <b>Rajput</b>, warrior clans who controlled the region for over
          a thousand years. However, being all of them always at war with each other for pride reasons, reduced them to
          be dependent on the <b>Moghul Empire</b>. After this empire collapsed, the Rajput tried to find an agreement
          with the English in order to be independent states under the English domination of India. Even after the
          Indian independence in 1947, many Maharajas maintained titles and properties. Finally, in the 70ies,
          Rajasthan, too, had to submit to the central control of the country. Nowadays, lost his power due to trade
          routes, Rajasthan is a popular touristic destination and maybe one of the most visited regions of the country.
          <br>For this reading, I suggest listening to Mahalaxmi Mantra Om Mahalaxmi Namo Namah Shri Mahalaxmi. This was
          a mantra we listened to during Diwali. It is quite long so it may not be even finished once you arrive at the
          end of the reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 1</b> <br>
          The very first day, the 18th of October, was the flight day. I met all the other participants (except for one)
          at the airport and it was exciting. I was so looking forward to going to India! We were 11 people including
          the coordinator: me, two girls, Jessica and Giulia, that already knew each other and were just one year older
          than me, Mauro, 50ish guy that traveled a lot already, Maurizio, 50ish guy, banker, Efrem, 40ish guy,
          policeman, Matteo and Rachele, super young couple of 22 that stayed most of the time on its own, Carmine, 39
          years old guy, Laura, the coordinator, 70ish. The first flight took us from Milan to Istanbul, where we met
          Marco, the 11th person, two years older than me and very nice. There, we also discovered that our flight to
          Delhi was delayed so we waited some hours in the airport. Then, they decided to anticipate the flight and we
          almost lost Marco there as he went for a walk. Thankfully, we all made it to the plane and, after 7 hours, we
          arrived in India!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 2</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          We arrived in India in the morning completely exhausted. And then a long 7 hours transfer was waiting for us.
          After we met the guy from the agency that had all our hotel reservations and documents, we walked to the bus.
          Our driver was a peculiar guy that spoke close to no English.
          Our very first destination was <b>Mandawa</b>, already in the region of Rajasthan. It is quite popular among
          tourists, that stop here to see the famous <b>Havelis</b>. These are houses built by rich merchants starting
          in the XVIII century, when new commercial ways were opened, to show off. The richer the decorations, the
          better. The name haveli means private space and it then became the term to indicate these specific buildings.
          Usually, Havelis are formed by two or more courtyards, the inner one for the women and private life for the
          family, where the merchants were welcomed, and deals were made.
          In this part of India, Havelis are decorated mostly with frescoes depicting gods (still not sure how many
          there are in Hinduism, 33 million, 330 million or more!) and later also trains, phones, planes. They are very
          beautiful but many of the houses we saw in Mandawa were left abandoned. This is something we found in every
          place we visited, and the abandonment is part of the charm even though from a European perspective, this
          sounds like a crime.
          We walked around the city in the late afternoon with two guys who guided us but, when dinner time arrived, we
          were more than happy to go back to the hotel (a haveli, too!) and rest a bit.
          The first dinner was good and an introduction to Indian cuisine: naan, spices, lentils, spices, paneer,
          spices… super tasty, especially if you are into spices!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 3</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          The day after we were more rested and eager to be on the road. Our first stop, not so far from Mandawa, was
          <b>Fatehpur</b>, a city founded in 1451 and full of Havelis. We went to see Le Prince Haveli, a beautiful
          building bought and completely restored by the French artist Nadine Le Prince and turned into a guesthouse for
          artists and a hotel. There we had a guided visit by a French girl who resides there who explained very well
          the haveli history and all the functions it had.
          <br>After seeing all these frescoes, we moved to <b>Deshnok</b>, where there is the famous Karni Mata Temple,
          also known as the <b>Temple of Rats</b>. Yes, rats. The story says that, when Karni Mata’s son died, she, as
          the reincarnation of Durga (one of the forms of Devi, the divine mother), brought him back to life and decided
          that the members of the family would not die but would reincarnate in kaba (rats). Nowadays, many citizens of
          Deshnok believe they descend from her and the rats are their ancestors. Besides all these religion/mythos
          stories, the temple is quite fascinating. You enter and see rats pretty much everywhere, especially where the
          devotes leave food offers. I had not the luck of having a rat stepping on my feet, but maybe that was not so
          bad.
          <br>Finally, we reached <b>Bikaner</b>, our last stop for the day. Bikaner is a desert city with a fort and
          that was an important stop for the caravans in the XVI century. We visited the fort that was impressive for
          the size and the decorations. Later we had a walk in the city with a guide and saw some other Havelis, the
          market, and a Jain temple.
          <br><i>As you may know, Hinduism is the main religion in India with 80.5% of the population. The main
            characteristic is to believe in <b>Brahman</b>, an infinite force that generates everything and to which
            everything will eventually go back. As I said, I still don’t know how many gods there are, even the guides
            seemed to be a little bit confused on this point. However, the main are Brahma, the generator, Vishnu, the
            operator, and Shiva, the destroyer. My favorite god is Ganesh, also the easiest to identify, who brings
            luck.
            13.4% of the population is Islamic, the biggest religious minority. Islam arrived around the XVII century
            when the Moghul Empire controlled the north part of the country.
            Other minorities are Sikhism, concentrated especially in Punjab and born as a revolt to the caste system and
            to the Muslim domination, the Buddhism, born in India but nowadays practiced by less than 1% of the
            population, and Jainism, as well born as a revolt to the caste system. The Jains believe that to be
            completely free, we need to get rid of the superficial, practicing a life of austerity, and don’t kill any
            form of life. Most extremes wear something in front of their mouth not to accidentally kill an insect and
            the monks usually have just a piece of fabric to cover themselves. –</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 4</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          Back on the road the day after, we arrived in <b>Pokhran</b>, a city famous for its fort (we saw maaaany
          forts). The building itself was beautiful but, as for the others we saw, there was nothing inside nor it was
          easy for us Europeans to completely appreciate it. However, we had an incredible guide that took us around. He
          knew maybe three or four words in Italian but what an entertainer! He took us pictures in the best spots of
          the palace and made us enjoy every minute we spent there.
          And then we were on the bus again to our destination of the day, the city of <b>Jaisalmer</b>. On the way, we
          stopped at <b>Bada Bagh</b>, where we saw the sunset at the cenotaphs of the Rajasthan maharajas. The view was
          great, and it was a good conclusion for the day.
          We then drove to our hotel that which was, once again, a haveli. This time, instead of frescoes, the
          decorations were made directly into the stone that was marvelously carved. It is typical of this area, and
          then further also in Jodhpur and Jaipur to have this kind of decoration, maybe also because Jaisalmer is in
          the desert and stones survive better than painting to sand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 5</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          We spent all day walking around Jaisalmer. It is a beautiful city with its own charm. From afar, the first
          thing you see is its <b>fort</b>, which seems a huge sand construction even though is quite a solid rock
          building that survived intact for more than 800 years. Jaisalmer was a very important city back in the
          centuries due to its strategic commercial position: only about 100 km west there is the border with Pakistan.
          However, after the wars between India and Pakistan in more recent decades, its power declined until it became
          only a popular destination for tourism. From the terrace of our hotel, you could have an impressive view of
          the fort, where over 3000 people reside, and the surrounding city.
          The visit was super interesting, as the guide was very informative and spoke good Italian. Of course, as any
          other guide we had, we had to stop in his shop. And of course, I bought something. I fell in love with a
          cashmere scarf that I plan to use a lot this winter. We visited some Havelis (yes, again) and various Jain
          temples until evening. Then, we head to dinner in a restaurant with a beautiful terrace.
          <br>So far, I didn’t say much about the group and its dynamics since it was difficult to understand everyone
          in the very first days but, as we reached Jaisalmer, I think everyone started to feel more at ease and entered
          into the Indian mood. India is different from every other country I have been to so far. I thought it would
          have had something in common with Sri Lanka and indeed there are many similarities but then, India is a
          completely different story. The dirt, the cows, the dogs, the trash, all the smells are something you are not
          prepared for and it makes you disgusted until something change and everything appears to be in the right
          place. I would say that day 4 was the day my perceptions changed.
          <img src="" alt="">
          <br>As for the group, we started understanding each other better. I bonded easily with Marco, Jessica, and
          Giulia as they were my age and we have things in common while the “older guys” bonded among them. In that
          sense, we had a sort of crack due to the age gap. It did not bother me so much but sometimes you felt it. An
          important topic for me was the room breakdown. Having one couple, 4 women and 5 men, I was worried to end up
          sharing the room with Laura, the coordinator, pretty much every day. Not nice. She was ok at the beginning but
          not the kind of person I would bond with. First of all, she was old. And I mean OLD. Plus, there were already
          been some moments I didn’t like her because she was not sharing details of the travel with the group (such as
          the choice of restaurant for the evening, the details of the activities day by day and so on) and was always
          acting as only what she said and thought was correct. Going back to the rooms, I stayed with her the first
          night, and then I tried to organize different arrangements for the rest of the days. Jessica and Giulia were
          helping a bit but no one was eager to really tackle the topic so, in the end, we were choosing at the very
          last minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 6</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          After two nights in a row in the same hotel and one day with no bus transfer, we were moving again. We first
          stopped just outside Jaisalmer on the <b>Gadisar lake</b>. In the morning it is very suggestive as there are
          some pavilions coming out of water. Later, the bus driver stopped close to a madrasa, that we quickly visited,
          and then arrived in <b>Osian</b>. Here we went to a Hindu temple first and then to a Jain temple. This city
          was an important commercial junction dominated by Jains and the Jain temple still preserves a statue of the
          XXIV Tirthankara (a savior and spiritual teacher) made with milk and sand.
          The highlight of the day, however, was the <b>Jodhpur fort</b> (yay, a fort!). Among all the ones we saw, this
          was the one I liked the most. From downhill, it looks majestic and imposing. You start walking up and, just
          next to the entrance, you can see the traces of the red hands, the testimony of the <b>sati</b>. This practice
          was endemic in medieval times in India among the highest castes: when a man died, the wife would burn alive.
          The ones here remember the maharajas’ wives that suicided. The last ones were in 1843. Nowadays, this practice
          is forbidden but some woman still practices it.
          Inside the fort, there are some interesting exhibitions, such as the ones with elephant palanquins, but the
          best part was the sunset view of the city of Jodhpur, also known as the <b>blue city</b>. It was founded in
          1200 by Rathore Rajput and then grew thanks to the trades with Gujarat. We, unfortunately, did not have time
          to properly visit the city but, after leaving the fort, we went to the hotel and then out for dinner. At that
          time, it was too dark to see the blue walls, but the city was still alive and fascinating. We had dinner in a
          beautiful restaurant with a spectacular view of the fort and I discovered one of the most delicious Indian
          delicacies: aloo gobhi, basically spiced cauliflowers and potatoes. Very simple but super tasty!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 7</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          This was perhaps the most intense day of all. We did over 350 kilometers and just two stops along the way. The
          first one was in <b>Ajmer</b>, where there is an important sanctuary dedicated to Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti,
          the founder of the first Sufi order in India. The place was super overcrowded, and the atmosphere is totally
          different compared to any other Islamic place I have ever visited. Even Islam is lived in a different, Indian,
          way: chaotic, noisy, and colorful. After that, we drove to <b>Pushkar</b>, a famous city for the yearly
          camels’ fair. I don’t have a good memory of that place. Along the sacred lake, there are various Ghats, also
          the one where Gandhi’s ashes were tossed. Among the people, there are so-called brahmins that make you sit and
          say a prayer asking for money. At this point, you cannot really refuse, and all the experience seems more like
          a scam. It is a pity because in Pushkar there is also one of the very few temples dedicated to Brahma, a place
          where a Hindu devoted should go at least once in his life.
          <br>Finally, we left Pushkar and we arrived in <b>Jaipur</b>, where we had the best hotel so far. The room we
          had was huge. We had a sort of living room with sofa and armchairs, then a huge bed and a bathroom that is
          bigger than my room at home. It had a bathtub in the middle surrounded by marble columns! Outside, there was
          also a very nice swimming pool. We were lucky we stayed there two nights. And, did I already mention it? It
          was a haveli.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 8</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          In Jaipur, we had another “relax” day with no long transfers. Jaipur is the Rajasthan capital city and one of
          the few cities in India (maybe the only one?) with urban planning.
          We met our guide in the morning and we headed first to the <b>Hawa Mahal</b> that we saw only from the
          outside. It is an incredible palace built in 1799 with red stone to allow the women of the court to see the
          life outside. After that, we drove to the <b>Amber Fort</b>, one of the most impressive in Rajasthan. This was
          built in 1592 as Amber was the capital of the Jaipur state. It is still now well preserved, and you can get an
          idea of how life was at the time.
          On the way back to the city, we had a quick look at the water palace, another royal family’s palace in the
          middle of the lake. To complete the historical tour, we stopped at the <b>Jantar Mantar</b> that, among all,
          was the most interesting place in the city. Jai Singh II was a maharaja with a strong interest in astronomy
          and made this complex been built to have the most accurate calculations of time and stars movement. You could
          stay there for hours to see how all this stuff works!
          We then spent the rest of the day wandering around until dinner, where we went to our guide’s home. After
          that, more wandering for some of us and some shopping. It was indeed the right day for shopping as in two days
          (the 27th of October) it would have been the culminating day of <b>Diwali</b> and it is tradition to buy
          something new to wear two days in advance.
          <br>Now, you may wonder what Diwali is. Diwali, also known as the <b>Festival of Lights</b>, is the
          celebration in Hinduism of the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.
          In the previous days, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces.
          During the climax, revelers adorn themselves in their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of
          their homes with diyas (oil lamps or candles), offer puja (worship) to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and
          wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is
          also a major cultural event for the Hindu and Jain diaspora from the Indian subcontinent. So, something quite
          big in India that we were preparing to experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 9</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          Unfortunately, the day we had to leave our beautiful hotel and the beautiful Jaipur has come and we left with
          <b>Agra</b> as our destination. Along the way, however, we also had two other interesting stops. The first
          was in <b>Abhaneri</b>, where there is an impressive well. I mean, not a well as we imagine it but with stairs
          designed with a unique geometry.
          After that, we went to <b>Fatehpur Sikri</b>. This archaeological site is a fortified city built in the XVI
          century and capital for a very short time of the Moghul Empire. Due to the lack of water, the city was then
          abandoned and forgotten. Nowadays, we can admire the perfect Indo-Islamic architecture and just imagine how it
          must have been in the past. Next to it, there is a mosque still in use and where many devotes go to pray at
          the tomb of the Sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chishti.
          We were in a bit of a rush for this visit as the drive to Agra was still a bit long and we wanted to make it
          before the sunset to have at least a brief view of the <b>Taj Mahal</b>. And so it was, we arrived just in
          time to catch a glimpse of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 10</b> <br>
          <img src="" alt="">
          The morning was tough as we woke up at 4.30 to be inside the Taj Mahal complex before sunrise. It was totally
          worth it. In the beginning, when you enter, you only see all the people. Then, you see the mausoleum and it is
          a big emotion. It is nothing different from what we
          saw already in pictures, advertising, movies, and books but it is still one of the most beautiful things I
          have ever seen. It is not a case that the poet Tagore described it as a <b>marble tear still on the cheek of
            time</b>.
          Now, you may know the story, but I will tell you just in case. The mausoleum was built by <b>Shah Jahan</b> in
          memory of his third wife, <b>Mumtaz Mahal</b>, who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. According to
          the legend, Shah’s hair became white for the desperation. The building of the entire complex took more than 20
          years. In the meantime, Shah’s son overthrew him and put him in the <b>Agra Fort</b> from which he could see
          the Taj Mahal from afar and where he spent the rest of his life. At his death, he was put next to his beloved
          wife.
          After the visit, we went back to the hotel, had breakfast, and went to visit the Agra Fort. Even though we
          were growing a bit tired of forts, this was indeed worth it. It was also very different from the ones we saw
          before (well, we were not in Rajasthan anymore either). Its architecture is Moghul and the building is
          immense. The materials used are marble and red sandstone. It would have been also nice if there was a bit less
          smog and we could appreciate the view but what I learned in India is that air pollution is, sadly, common.
          <br>After the visit, we took the bus and left for <b>Orchha</b>, a city I didn’t know existed until this
          travel but that was a beautiful and unexpected surprise. The hotel we were in was super nice and, as I
          mentioned, it was the culminating day of Diwali. We arrived and they put us on flower necklaces, and they had
          decorations everywhere. They also fired some crackers and put music on. It was just beautiful.
