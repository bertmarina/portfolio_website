          This is the first travel I did to India and it was definitely intense. Every day we had at least 5/7 hours on
          the bus because the distance between each leg was quite big and the roads in India are not even close to what
          we are used here in Europe. As the first bite of this huge country, I chose <b>Rajasthan</b> and I travelled
          with the same agency I travelled to Sri Lanka before, <b>Viaggi e Avventure nel Mondo</b>. Before digging
          into the specifics of the travel, though, I think a brief introduction is important.
          <br>Rajasthan, known as the Land of Kings, is the richest region of India with fortresses and majestic
          architectonical works. This is the land of the <b>Rajput</b>, warrior clans who controlled the region for over
          a thousand years. However, being all of them always at war with each other for pride reasons, reduced them to
          be dependent on the <b>Moghul Empire</b>. After this empire collapsed, the Rajput tried to find an agreement
          with the English in order to be independent states under the English domination of India. Even after the
          Indian independence in 1947, many Maharajas maintained titles and properties. Finally, in the 70ies,
          Rajasthan, too, had to submit to the central control of the country. Nowadays, lost his power due to trade
          routes, Rajasthan is a popular touristic destination and maybe one of the most visited regions of the country.
          <br>For this reading, I suggest listening to Mahalaxmi Mantra Om Mahalaxmi Namo Namah Shri Mahalaxmi. This was
          a mantra we listened to during Diwali. It is quite long so it may not be even finished once you arrive at the
          end of the reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 1</b> <br>
          The very first day, the 18th of October, was the flight day. I met all the other participants (except for one)
          at the airport and it was exciting. I was so looking forward to going to India! We were 11 people including
          the coordinator: me, two girls, Jessica and Giulia, that already knew each other and were just one year older
          than me, Mauro, 50ish guy that traveled a lot already, Maurizio, 50ish guy, banker, Efrem, 40ish guy,
          policeman, Matteo and Rachele, super young couple of 22 that stayed most of the time on its own, Carmine, 39
          years old guy, Laura, the coordinator, 70ish. The first flight took us from Milan to Istanbul, where we met
          Marco, the 11th person, two years older than me and very nice. There, we also discovered that our flight to
          Delhi was delayed so we waited some hours in the airport. Then, they decided to anticipate the flight and we
          almost lost Marco there as he went for a walk. Thankfully, we all made it to the plane and, after 7 hours, we
          arrived in India!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 2</b> <br>
          We arrived in India in the morning completely exhausted. And then a long 7 hours transfer was waiting for us.
          After we met the guy from the agency that had all our hotel reservations and documents, we walked to the bus.
          Our driver was a peculiar guy that spoke close to no English.
          <img src="./story_images/raja1.jpg" class="big left" alt="">
          Our very first destination was <b>Mandawa</b>, already in the region of Rajasthan. It is quite popular among
          tourists, that stop here to see the famous <b>Havelis</b>. These are houses built by rich merchants starting
          in the XVIII century, when new commercial ways were opened, to show off. The richer the decorations, the
          better. The name haveli means private space and it then became the term to indicate these specific buildings.
          Usually, Havelis are formed by two or more courtyards, the inner one for the women and private life for the
          family, where the merchants were welcomed, and deals were made.
          In this part of India, Havelis are decorated mostly with frescoes depicting gods (still not sure how many
          there are in Hinduism, 33 million, 330 million or more!) and later also trains, phones, planes. They are very
          beautiful but many of the houses we saw in Mandawa were left abandoned. This is something we found in every
          place we visited, and the abandonment is part of the charm even though from a European perspective, this
          sounds like a crime.
          We walked around the city in the late afternoon with two guys who guided us but, when dinner time arrived, we
          were more than happy to go back to the hotel (a haveli, too!) and rest a bit.
          The first dinner was good and an introduction to Indian cuisine: naan, spices, lentils, spices, paneer,
          spices… super tasty, especially if you are into spices!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 3</b> <br>
          The day after we were more rested and eager to be on the road. Our first stop, not so far from Mandawa, was
          <b>Fatehpur</b>, a city founded in 1451 and full of Havelis. We went to see Le Prince Haveli, a beautiful
          building bought and completely restored by the French artist Nadine Le Prince and turned into a guesthouse for
          artists and a hotel. There we had a guided visit by a French girl who resides there who explained very well
          the haveli history and all the functions it had.
          <img src="./story_images/raja2.jpg" class="big right" alt="">
          <br>After seeing all these frescoes, we moved to <b>Deshnok</b>, where there is the famous Karni Mata Temple,
          also known as the <b>Temple of Rats</b>. Yes, rats. The story says that, when Karni Mata’s son died, she, as
          the reincarnation of Durga (one of the forms of Devi, the divine mother), brought him back to life and decided
          that the members of the family would not die but would reincarnate in kaba (rats). Nowadays, many citizens of
          Deshnok believe they descend from her and the rats are their ancestors. Besides all these religion/mythos
          stories, the temple is quite fascinating. You enter and see rats pretty much everywhere, especially where the
          devotes leave food offers. I had not the luck of having a rat stepping on my feet, but maybe that was not so
          bad.
          <br>Finally, we reached <b>Bikaner</b>, our last stop for the day. Bikaner is a desert city with a fort and
          that was an important stop for the caravans in the XVI century. We visited the fort that was impressive for
          the size and the decorations. Later we had a walk in the city with a guide and saw some other Havelis, the
          market, and a Jain temple.
          <br><i>As you may know, Hinduism is the main religion in India with 80.5% of the population. The main
            characteristic is to believe in <b>Brahman</b>, an infinite force that generates everything and to which
            everything will eventually go back. As I said, I still don’t know how many gods there are, even the guides
            seemed to be a little bit confused on this point. However, the main are Brahma, the generator, Vishnu, the
            operator, and Shiva, the destroyer. My favorite god is Ganesh, also the easiest to identify, who brings
            luck.
            13.4% of the population is Islamic, the biggest religious minority. Islam arrived around the XVII century
            when the Moghul Empire controlled the north part of the country.
            Other minorities are Sikhism, concentrated especially in Punjab and born as a revolt to the caste system and
            to the Muslim domination, the Buddhism, born in India but nowadays practiced by less than 1% of the
            population, and Jainism, as well born as a revolt to the caste system. The Jains believe that to be
            completely free, we need to get rid of the superficial, practicing a life of austerity, and don’t kill any
            form of life. Most extremes wear something in front of their mouth not to accidentally kill an insect and
            the monks usually have just a piece of fabric to cover themselves. –</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        <img src="./story_images/raja3.jpg" class="small left" alt="">
          <b>Day 4</b> <br>
          Back on the road the day after, we arrived in <b>Pokhran</b>, 
          a city famous for its fort (we saw maaaany
          forts). The building itself was beautiful but, as for the others we saw, there was nothing inside nor it was
          easy for us Europeans to completely appreciate it. However, we had an incredible guide that took us around. He
          knew maybe three or four words in Italian but what an entertainer! He took us pictures in the best spots of
          the palace and made us enjoy every minute we spent there.
          And then we were on the bus again to our destination of the day, the city of <b>Jaisalmer</b>. On the way, we
          stopped at <b>Bada Bagh</b>, where we saw the sunset at the cenotaphs of the Rajasthan maharajas. The view was
          great, and it was a good conclusion for the day.
          We then drove to our hotel that which was, once again, a haveli. This time, instead of frescoes, the
          decorations were made directly into the stone that was marvelously carved. It is typical of this area, and
          then further also in Jodhpur and Jaipur to have this kind of decoration, maybe also because Jaisalmer is in
          the desert and stones survive better than painting to sand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 5</b> <br>
          We spent all day walking around Jaisalmer. It is a beautiful city with its own charm. From afar, the first
          thing you see is its <b>fort</b>, which seems a huge sand construction even though is quite a solid rock
          building that survived intact for more than 800 years. Jaisalmer was a very important city back in the
          centuries due to its strategic commercial position: only about 100 km west there is the border with Pakistan.
          However, after the wars between India and Pakistan in more recent decades, its power declined until it became
          only a popular destination for tourism. From the terrace of our hotel, you could have an impressive view of
          the fort, where over 3000 people reside, and the surrounding city.
          <img src="./story_images/raja4.jpg" class="big right" alt="">
          The visit was super interesting, as the guide was very informative and spoke good Italian. Of course, as any
          other guide we had, we had to stop in his shop. And of course, I bought something. I fell in love with a
          cashmere scarf that I plan to use a lot this winter. We visited some Havelis (yes, again) and various Jain
          temples until evening. Then, we head to dinner in a restaurant with a beautiful terrace.
          <br>So far, I didn’t say much about the group and its dynamics since it was difficult to understand everyone
          in the very first days but, as we reached Jaisalmer, I think everyone started to feel more at ease and entered
          into the Indian mood. India is different from every other country I have been to so far. I thought it would
          have had something in common with Sri Lanka and indeed there are many similarities but then, India is a
          completely different story. The dirt, the cows, the dogs, the trash, all the smells are something you are not
          prepared for and it makes you disgusted until something change and everything appears to be in the right
          place. I would say that day 4 was the day my perceptions changed.
          <br>As for the group, we started understanding each other better. I bonded easily with Marco, Jessica, and
          Giulia as they were my age and we have things in common while the “older guys” bonded among them. In that
          sense, we had a sort of crack due to the age gap. It did not bother me so much but sometimes you felt it. An
          important topic for me was the room breakdown. Having one couple, 4 women and 5 men, I was worried to end up
          sharing the room with Laura, the coordinator, pretty much every day. Not nice. She was ok at the beginning but
          not the kind of person I would bond with. First of all, she was old. And I mean OLD. Plus, there were already
          been some moments I didn’t like her because she was not sharing details of the travel with the group (such as
          the choice of restaurant for the evening, the details of the activities day by day and so on) and was always
          acting as only what she said and thought was correct. Going back to the rooms, I stayed with her the first
          night, and then I tried to organize different arrangements for the rest of the days. Jessica and Giulia were
          helping a bit but no one was eager to really tackle the topic so, in the end, we were choosing at the very
          last minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 6</b> <br>
          After two nights in a row in the same hotel and one day with no bus transfer, we were moving again. We first
          stopped just outside Jaisalmer on the <b>Gadisar lake</b>. 
          <img src="./story_images/raja5.jpg" class="small left" alt="">
          In the morning it is very suggestive as there are
          some pavilions coming out of water. Later, the bus driver stopped close to a madrasa, that we quickly visited,
          and then arrived in <b>Osian</b>. Here we went to a Hindu temple first and then to a Jain temple. This city
          was an important commercial junction dominated by Jains and the Jain temple still preserves a statue of the
          XXIV Tirthankara (a savior and spiritual teacher) made with milk and sand.
          The highlight of the day, however, was the <b>Jodhpur fort</b> (yay, a fort!). Among all the ones we saw, this
          was the one I liked the most. From downhill, it looks majestic and imposing. You start walking up and, just
          next to the entrance, you can see the traces of the red hands, the testimony of the <b>sati</b>. This practice
          was endemic in medieval times in India among the highest castes: when a man died, the wife would burn alive.
          The ones here remember the maharajas’ wives that suicided. The last ones were in 1843. Nowadays, this practice
          is forbidden but some woman still practices it.
          Inside the fort, there are some interesting exhibitions, such as the ones with elephant palanquins, but the
          best part was the sunset view of the city of Jodhpur, also known as the <b>blue city</b>. It was founded in
          1200 by Rathore Rajput and then grew thanks to the trades with Gujarat. We, unfortunately, did not have time
          to properly visit the city but, after leaving the fort, we went to the hotel and then out for dinner. At that
          time, it was too dark to see the blue walls, but the city was still alive and fascinating. We had dinner in a
          beautiful restaurant with a spectacular view of the fort and I discovered one of the most delicious Indian
          delicacies: aloo gobhi, basically spiced cauliflowers and potatoes. Very simple but super tasty!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 7</b> <br>
          This was perhaps the most intense day of all. We did over 350 kilometers and just two stops along the way. The
          first one was in <b>Ajmer</b>,
          <img src="./story_images/raja6.jpg" class="big right" alt="">
           where there is an important sanctuary dedicated to Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti,
          the founder of the first Sufi order in India. The place was super overcrowded, and the atmosphere is totally
          different compared to any other Islamic place I have ever visited. Even Islam is lived in a different, Indian,
          way: chaotic, noisy, and colorful. After that, we drove to <b>Pushkar</b>, a famous city for the yearly
          camels’ fair. I don’t have a good memory of that place. Along the sacred lake, there are various Ghats, also
          the one where Gandhi’s ashes were tossed. Among the people, there are so-called brahmins that make you sit and
          say a prayer asking for money. At this point, you cannot really refuse, and all the experience seems more like
          a scam. It is a pity because in Pushkar there is also one of the very few temples dedicated to Brahma, a place
          where a Hindu devoted should go at least once in his life.
          <br>Finally, we left Pushkar and we arrived in <b>Jaipur</b>, where we had the best hotel so far. The room we
          had was huge. We had a sort of living room with sofa and armchairs, then a huge bed and a bathroom that is
          bigger than my room at home. It had a bathtub in the middle surrounded by marble columns! Outside, there was
          also a very nice swimming pool. We were lucky we stayed there two nights. And, did I already mention it? It
          was a haveli.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 8</b> <br>
          In Jaipur, we had another “relax” day with no long transfers. Jaipur is the Rajasthan capital city and one of
          the few cities in India (maybe the only one?) with urban planning.
          <img src="./story_images/raja7.jpg" class="big left" alt="">
          We met our guide in the morning and we headed first to the <b>Hawa Mahal</b> that we saw only from the
          outside. It is an incredible palace built in 1799 with red stone to allow the women of the court to see the
          life outside. After that, we drove to the <b>Amber Fort</b>, one of the most impressive in Rajasthan. This was
          built in 1592 as Amber was the capital of the Jaipur state. It is still now well preserved, and you can get an
          idea of how life was at the time.
          On the way back to the city, we had a quick look at the water palace, another royal family’s palace in the
          middle of the lake. To complete the historical tour, we stopped at the <b>Jantar Mantar</b> that, among all,
          was the most interesting place in the city. Jai Singh II was a maharaja with a strong interest in astronomy
          and made this complex been built to have the most accurate calculations of time and stars movement. You could
          stay there for hours to see how all this stuff works!
          We then spent the rest of the day wandering around until dinner, where we went to our guide’s home. After
          that, more wandering for some of us and some shopping. It was indeed the right day for shopping as in two days
          (the 27th of October) it would have been the culminating day of <b>Diwali</b> and it is tradition to buy
          something new to wear two days in advance.
          <br>Now, you may wonder what Diwali is. Diwali, also known as the <b>Festival of Lights</b>, is the
          celebration in Hinduism of the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.
          In the previous days, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces.
          During the climax, revelers adorn themselves in their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of
          their homes with diyas (oil lamps or candles), offer puja (worship) to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and
          wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is
          also a major cultural event for the Hindu and Jain diaspora from the Indian subcontinent. So, something quite
          big in India that we were preparing to experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 9</b> <br>
          Unfortunately, the day we had to leave our beautiful hotel and the beautiful Jaipur has come and we left with
          <b>Agra</b> as our destination. Along the way, however, we also had two other interesting stops. The first
          was in <b>Abhaneri</b>, where there is an impressive well. I mean, not a well as we imagine it but with stairs
          designed with a unique geometry.
          After that, we went to <b>Fatehpur Sikri</b>. This archaeological site is a fortified city built in the XVI
          century and capital for a very short time of the Moghul Empire. Due to the lack of water, the city was then
          abandoned and forgotten. Nowadays, we can admire the perfect Indo-Islamic architecture and just imagine how it
          must have been in the past. Next to it, there is a mosque still in use and where many devotes go to pray at
          the tomb of the Sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chishti.
          We were in a bit of a rush for this visit as the drive to Agra was still a bit long and we wanted to make it
          before the sunset to have at least a brief view of the <b>Taj Mahal</b>. And so it was, we arrived just in
          time to catch a glimpse of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 10</b> <br>
          The morning was tough as we woke up at 4.30 to be inside the Taj Mahal complex before sunrise. It was totally
          worth it. In the beginning, when you enter, you only see all the people. Then, you see the mausoleum and it is
          a big emotion. It is nothing different from what we
          <img src="./story_images/raja8.jpg" class="big right" alt="">
          saw already in pictures, advertising, movies, and books but it is still one of the most beautiful things I
          have ever seen. It is not a case that the poet Tagore described it as a <b>marble tear still on the cheek of
            time</b>.
          Now, you may know the story, but I will tell you just in case. The mausoleum was built by <b>Shah Jahan</b> in
          memory of his third wife, <b>Mumtaz Mahal</b>, who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. According to
          the legend, Shah’s hair became white for the desperation. The building of the entire complex took more than 20
          years. In the meantime, Shah’s son overthrew him and put him in the <b>Agra Fort</b> from which he could see
          the Taj Mahal from afar and where he spent the rest of his life. At his death, he was put next to his beloved
          wife.
          After the visit, we went back to the hotel, had breakfast, and went to visit the Agra Fort. Even though we
          were growing a bit tired of forts, this was indeed worth it. It was also very different from the ones we saw
          before (well, we were not in Rajasthan anymore either). Its architecture is Moghul and the building is
          immense. The materials used are marble and red sandstone. It would have been also nice if there was a bit less
          smog and we could appreciate the view but what I learned in India is that air pollution is, sadly, common.
          <br>After the visit, we took the bus and left for <b>Orchha</b>, a city I didn’t know existed until this
          travel but that was a beautiful and unexpected surprise. The hotel we were in was super nice and, as I
          mentioned, it was the culminating day of Diwali. We arrived and they put us on flower necklaces, and they had
          decorations everywhere. They also fired some crackers and put music on. It was just beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 11</b> <br>
          Today was pretty intense. We went to the city center of Orchha. As I said, this city was an unexpected
          surprise. Its history is connected to the <b>Bundela rajput clan</b>, who elected it as their capital in 1531
          until 1783. 
          <img src="./story_images/raja9.jpg" class="big left" alt="">
          Because of this, there are many royal palaces and cenotaphs that is possible to visit.
          What surprised me the most was that inside these palaces there are still very well preserved and beautiful
          frescoes. Just imagine immense palaces decorated in every corner! Unfortunately, as often in India, there is
          no care for this heritage and everything is more or less abandoned. It is also true that this is my European
          point of view talking and in Asia there is not the same concept of conservation they have there. And in some
          regards, the abandonment gives to this place an additional charm.
          We found a guide that walked us around talking in a terrible English. The result is that we learned almost
          nothing and we had to work on imagination. After three hours, the visit was done and we wandered for a bit in
          the city. It was full of people and street vendors as everyone was still celebrating Diwali and going in
          pilgrimage to the <b>Ram Raja Temple</b>. As the name says, this temple is dedicated to god Rama and,
          especially in Diwali, the pilgrims are many. We then sat in a bar to relax a bit and just enjoy the
          celebrations. It was anyhow not bad when we drove back to the hotel in the afternoon and stayed a bit at the
          pool. Later we went to another hotel for dinner and then had a final walk in the city and saw all the pilgrims
          still celebrating and chanting around the temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 12</b> <br>
          Another day, another early alarm. We drove to <b>Khajuraho</b> and the road was one of the worst we saw so
          far. We basically jumped every minute, especially me, seating in the back.
          <img src="./story_images/raja10.jpg" class="small right" alt="">
          Arrived in Kajuraho, we left our stuff in the hotel and went to the city with our guide. This city is mostly
          famous for its temples with <b>erotic sculptures</b> and indeed they were interesting. However, they are not
          the only representations you see as all the temples are a sort of comic of the time (time being the X and XI
          centuries). 85 were the temples erected in the area but only 25 survive now and only one is still used as a
          temple for ceremonies.
          We first went to visit the occidental group, where the best preserved and beautiful are enclosed in order to
          take care of them. In truth, they are all very similar to each other, having even the same scenes depicted all
          around, but seeing all of them at glance is incredible. Some of the erotic scenes are really absurd and the
          guide even warned us not to try them unless we were yoga pro!
          <br>After the temples, we went to see the old part of the town as we were waiting for the sunset to attend a
          puja (prayer). The town was nothing exceptional but I discovered that there is a celebration even for <b>cows
            poo</b> during Diwali. Poo is burned in front of every house for luck. Maybe we should try, in Switzerland
          it should not be hard to find some!
          The puja we attended at sunset was perhaps the most authentic one. It was in the only ancient temple in
          Khajuraho still active as temple. It is dedicated to Shiva and inside there is a huge lingam (a fallic symbol
          of Shiva) and the prayer consisted in a long, deafening bell ringing. At the beginning was fastidious but
          after a while you could feel you were almost going into a trance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 13</b> <br>
          The night was short as we all, except for the coordinator, signed up to go to the <b>Panna Tiger Reserve</b>
          to see… the leopard! No, kidding, to see the tiger! We were on three different jeeps and mine was super lucky
          <img src="./story_images/raja11.jpg" class="small left" alt="">
          as we saw a tiger soon. She crossed the street and did not even pay attention to us. Moreover, we were the
          only car there, so we really enjoyed that moment. The safari itself was ok, it is basically designed to see
          the tiger. However, given the fact that we saw her at the beginning, we then drove to some other areas and saw
          other animals (lots of spiders!) and panoramas. Once back, we had breakfast and then we went to see other
          temples in Khajuraho. Early in the afternoon we left with the bus to go to <b>Satna</b> where we said goodbye
          to our driver and started a new adventure: taking a <b>(night) train</b> in India (to Varanasi).
          <br>The station in Satna is not super big but it was still quite hard to find our train. First, all the signs
          were in Hindi. I did not mention it before, but Indians are not very good at speaking English so even asking
          information was sometimes hard. As the coordinator was not keen in giving us the booking references and our
          train seemed to have disappeared from every screen, we had to start asking people. Apparently, there is an app
          they use which is very accurate but not on my phone (probably you need to be Indian to be able to use it).
          After some, expected, hours of waiting, our train finally arrived. We then had to find our seats (not easy as
          we did not have the references…) and prepare our comfortable beds. It was not so bad, only the super tall
          people struggled a bit especially because we kept our baggage on the beds with us, so we had less space left.
          The beds were ok, and we even had sheets. Also the toilets were ok. We set our alarms and tried to sleep a
          bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 14</b> <br>
          The night was ok, we had a bit of sleep but not too much as we were also worried to get down at the right
          station. The train would continue for another entire day to go who knows where. Some people helped us and some
          of them were curious about us. I bet it is not very common to see a bunch of western people on a night train
          as we were, especially on a less used line (the train from Khajuraho was fully booked).
          <img src="./story_images/raja12.jpg" class="big right" alt="">
          In <b>Varanasi</b> we were picked up by a guide that drove us to our hotel. We would have never found it if it
          was not for him but at least the hotel was in a strategic position just in front of the Gange river.
          <br>Varanasi is another world. Even after two weeks in India, you are not completely prepared for it. It is
          humid, it is dirty, it is rotting, it is dead and alive, it is smelly. I thought people were exaggerating in
          saying not everyone can stand it but now I can say I agree. For me it was a bit shocky at the beginning but
          then I did not care too much. I just followed the stream, literally. We again left our stuff in the rooms and
          went out to explore. We walked along the river for a while seeing all the <b>ghats</b> (stairs) where people
          go to bath, to wash their clothes, to pray and to do all possible daily activities. Of course, we also went to
          see the burning sites. Varanasi is considered, in fact, the best place where to die and all the Hindus want to
          have their ashes spread in the sacred river. Who dies here will never reincarnate again and his soul will be
          free. We saw some temples even if many are inside the houses walls and therefore private. Early in the
          afternoon we went back to the hotel to rest a bit. Soon, anyway, we had to move to meet our guide to go on the
          Gange with a boat at sunset. It was nice seeing the city from a little afar. In a way it was refreshing not to
          be immersed in the crowd and its smell but it was short as we then went to the puja. This time, I did not like
          it that much as it seemed fake. But maybe the show off and the kitsch is part of the Hinduism rituals and it
          was more authentic than I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 15</b> <br>
          In the morning, we took the boat again and saw the sunrise from there. The shore was already full of people
          bathing and praying before starting the morning and the pyres were burning as they do at every hour. 5 of us
          decided then to have a yoga lesson so we went to our guide’s home rooftop where a young Russian now living in
          India girl taught us for almost two hours. My back after that was hurting so much! But the experience was
          nice. I mean, when will I experience again yoga in Varanasi?
          The rest of the day was quiet, I stayed in the hotel while the rest was shopping around a bit and in the
          afternoon we all went to the airport to fly to New Delhi. The flight was ok but once in Delhi, the pick up bus
          was not there. After some calls, we found out the guide with the bus was waiting in the wrong place so it was
          not a major issue and we soon arrived at the hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 16</b> <br>
          As our last day in India, this was not a great day. <b>Delhi</b> is ugly, not because there are ugly things
          but because it is a chaotic metropolis immerse in the smog. 
          <img src="./story_images/raja13.jpg" class="small left" alt="">
          It was hard even breathing. In addition to that,
          the group kind of broke up: the young couple left and went to explore alone and the others were all nervous
          and tired. I was actually quite interested in seeing something of the city and we also had a bus booked for us
          all day. In the end, we managed to see just a couple of things.
          We went to see the <b>Red Fort</b> (what if not a fort to conclude our trip?) but it was hard to enjoy it: the
          smog was covering it all.
          Later we went to the <b>Lotus Temple</b> that was the most surprising thing. It is a temple with a lotus
          flower shape in which all the religions are welcomed and you can pray or meditate. Only five of us went but it
          was really worthy! It is a pity we did not get to see all the others sights but we were not even in the spirit
          of enjoying them. We had our last supper next to our hotel. It was good but my stomachache (it started few
          days before, most probably due to tiredness) did not allow me to enjoy it that much.
        </p>
        <b>Day 17</b> <br>
        This was the day we were leaving and the day we had a real adventure in the airports. We left early but then our
        flight was delayed of several hours because of the smog. Our reservation was under Turkish Airlines but the
        flight from Delhi to Istanbul was operated by Indigo, a low cost company. We arrived super late in Istanbul and,
        even if the gate was still open, the hostesses refused us to get on the plane.
        At that point some in the groups got super upset. We went to the transfer desk to get new boarding passes and,
        after 5 hours (!), we got them. We had to speak with several people as Indigo was blaming Turkish and viceversa.
        In the beginning, they only gave us new tickets that were for flights in 48 hours! The final ones we got were
        for the next afternoon so we also had to find a place to sleep. Of course no company paid for that.
        In the desperation of the moment, we were lucky Istanbul airport has a hotel just inside so we did not have to
        find other, far, places where to go. The hotel was actually very nice and the beds amazing and thankfully they
        had space for all of us.
        The day after we were all in a better mood and had breakfast to start the day. We had to fight again with
        Turkish to get the lunch vouchers but managed to get those, too.
        Finally, at 4, we left Istanbul to Milan. It may seem it is over if it was not for the six missing suitcases
        (not mine, thanks Ganesh!) that apparently decided to stay behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many reasons, this is a travel I will remember dearly. India is a fascinating place full of contradictions
          and too easily portrayed. In some moments, I felt like it was enough but now I wish to go back to India and
          explore it a little more. Hopefully it will happen soon!
